# GLAPI (Golink API)

## Introduction

The Golink API (GLAPI) is a RESTful API that allows you to create, read, update, and delete links and namespaces.
This API is used by the [Golink CLI](/glctl/concept) and the Golink ui.

The API respects the [OpenAPI 3.0](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification and is documented in the dedicated [API documentation](/api/api).

## Authentication

!!! info "Authentication"
    Currently, the API does not support authentication. This is a planned feature.
